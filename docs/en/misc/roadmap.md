# Roadmap

We expect to support some of the features listed below in the future, but we do not guarantee that all of the features listed below will be supported in the next release, nor do we guarantee that they will be implemented in the order listed below.

### Support for more community plugins and loader

As webpack contains a large number of api, we will be supporting some of the most frequently used loaders and plugins based on feedback from the community.

### Module Federation support

Module Federation is a widely used webpack feature with a rich ecosystem and we will be working with the author of Module Federation [Zack Jackson](https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy) to develop this feature.

### Vue and Svelte support

Vue and Svelte are two very popular front-end frameworks that are more complex to support than React and rely on more internal webpack api. We expect to complete support for both frameworks in the future to support the full vue and svelte ecosystem.

### Lazy Compilation support

Although Rspack currently has good performance, there is still a lot of room to improve performance for projects with a large number of pages, and Lazy Compilation is a good way to improve performance.
