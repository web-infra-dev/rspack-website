# Externals

Used to instruct Rspack to use external dependencies and load them in runtime, thus avoiding the need to bundle these libraries into the project.

- **Type:** `Record<string, string>`
- **Default:** `{}`

## Example

### Target set to web

When [target](/config/target) is configured as `web`, the default is to use window for loading:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  externals: {
    react: 'react',
    'react-dom': 'reactDom',
  },
};
```

You can use `react` and `react-dom` directly in your project:

```ts
import React from 'react';
import ReactDom from 'react-dom';
```

The above react and react-dom will not be included in the final bundle and will be loaded at runtime using `window.react` and `window.reactDom`.

### Target set to node

When [target](/config/target) is configured as `node`, the commonjs loading logic is used by default to load:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  externals: {
    'fs-extra': 'fs-extra',
  },
};
```

You can use `fs-extra` directly in your project.

```ts
import fs from 'fs-extra';
```

The above fs-extra will not be included in the final bundle and will be loaded at runtime using ``require("fs-extra")`.
