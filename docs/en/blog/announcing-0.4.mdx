We are pleased to announce **the release of** **[Rsbuild](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild)** **v0.1!** This milestone indicates that the Rsbuild API is now more stable and reliable to use.

Rsbuild is an Rspack-based build tool, designed to be **an enhanced Rspack** **CLI** that is both more user friendly and powerful. As a result of the Rspack team's exploration and implementation of best practices for web building, Rsbuild is the ideal solution for those looking to migrate from Webpack to Rspack. It significantly reduces configuration by 90% while offering a 10x build speed.

### ðŸš€ Performance

The build performance of Rsbuild is on par with native Rspack. Considering that Rsbuild includes more out-of-the-box features, its performance will be slightly lower than Rspack.

This is the time it takes to build 1000 React components:

> The data is based on the benchmark built by the Farm team, more info in [performance-compare](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/performance-compare).

### ðŸ”¥ Features

Rsbuild has the following features:

- **Easy to Configure**: One of the goals of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box build capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration. In addition, Rsbuild provides semantic build configuration to reduce the learning curve for Rspack configuration.

- **Performance Oriented**: Rsbuild integrates high-performance Rust-based tools from the community, including [Rspack](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack) and [SWC](https://swc.rs/), to deliver top-notch build speed and development experience. Compared to webpack-based tools like Create React App and Vue CLI, Rsbuild provides 5 to 10 times faster build performance and lighter dependencies.

- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rsbuild has a lightweight plugin system and includes a range of high-quality official plugins. Furthermore, Rsbuild is compatible with most webpack plugins and all Rspack plugins, allowing users to leverage existing community or in-house plugins in Rsbuild without the need for rewriting code.

- **Stable Artifacts**: Rsbuild is designed with a strong focus on the stability of build artifacts. It ensures high consistency between artifacts in the development environment and production builds, and automatically completes syntax downgrading and polyfill injection. Rsbuild also provides plugins for type checking and artifact syntax validation to prevent quality and compatibility issues in production code.

- **Framework Agnostic**: Rsbuild is not coupled with any front-end UI framework. It supports frameworks like React, Vue 3, Vue 2, Svelte, and Lit through plugins, and plans to support more UI frameworks from the community in the future.

## Major Changes

### Drop NodeJS 14 Support

Rspack no longer supports Node.js 14, Node.js 16+ is now required.

### Make @rspack/core as peerDep of @rspack/cli

`@rspack/core` is now a peerDependency of `@rspack/cli` rather than a direct dependency. This means that you need to manually install `@rspack/core` with `@rspack/cli` now. aligning Rspack more closely with webpack. In the long term, the positioning of `@rspack/cli` will no longer be an out-of-the-box solution. We will align `@rspack/cli` with webpack-cli and may even directly support the use of `@rspack/core` in `webpack-cli`. We recommend [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) as an out-of-the-box solution.

### Deprecating default transformation

`experiments.rspackFuture.disableTransformByDefault` is enabled by default in v0.4.0. For people that still need the legacy behavior, you may manually set this option to `false`.

This feature primarily addresses three categories of problems: [builtins](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins) code transformation features, [target](https://www.rspack.dev/config/target), and custom [Rule.type](https://www.rspack.dev/config/module#ruletype).

1.  Removal of support for some [[builtins](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins) features:

- [[builtins.relay](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsrelay)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsrelay): moved to `rspackExperiments.relay`
- [[builtins.react](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsreact)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsreact): moved to `jsc.transform.react`
- [[builtins.emotion](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsemotion)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsemotion): moved to `rspackExperiments.emotion`
- [[builtins.pluginImport](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinspluginimport)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinspluginimport): moved to `rspackExperiments.import`
- [[builtins.decorator](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsdecorator)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinsdecorator): moved to `jsc.parser.decorator`
- [[builtins.presetEnv](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinspresetenv)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins#builtinspresetenv): moved to `jsc.env`

```

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /.jsx$/,
        loader: 'builtin:swc-loader',
        options: {
          jsc: {
            parser: {
              syntax: "ecmascript",
              jsx: true
            }
          },
          rspackExperiments: {
            emotion: true // The same as `builtins`
          }
        }
        type: 'javascript/auto',
      },
    ],
  },
  experiments: {
    rspackFuture: {
      disableTransformByDefault: true
    }
  }
};
```

2.  [[target](https://www.rspack.dev/config/target)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/target) will not downgrade user-side code

```diff
module.exports = {
  target: ["web", "es5"],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'builtin:swc-loader',
        options: {
          jsc: {
            parser: {
              syntax: "ecmascript"
            },
+           target: "es5" // Notice: `jsc.target` and `env` cannot be set at the same time.
          },
+        env: { //  Notice: `jsc.target` and `env` cannot be set at the same time.
+         targets: "chrome >= 48"
+        }
        }
        type: 'javascript/auto',
      },
    ],
  }
};
```

3.  Removed non-webpack compatible [[Rule.type](https://www.rspack.dev/config/module#ruletype)](https://www.rspack.dev/config/module#ruletype)

These types have been removed:

- `"typescript"`
- `"jsx"`
- `"tsx"`

For JS-related types, only the following will be retained:

- `"javascript/auto"`
- `"javascript/esm"`
- `"javascript/dynamic"`

Refer to [this](https://www.rspack.dev/config/experiments.html#experimentsrspackfuturedisabletransformbydefault) for the complete migration guide.

Check out our previous discussion [here](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/discussions/4070).

### Deprecating builtin.react.refresh

With `experiments.rspackFuture.disableTransformByDefault` is enabled by default in v0.4.0, `builtin.react.refresh` has also been deprecated. Now we recommend using `@rspack/plugin-react-refresh` to enable react fast refresh.

```diff
+ const ReactRefreshPlugin = require('@rspack/plugin-react-refresh');
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

module.exports = {
  // ...
  mode: isDev ? 'development' : 'production',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /.jsx$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'builtin:swc-loader',
          options: {
            jsc: {
              parser: {
                syntax: 'ecmascript',
                jsx: true,
              },
              transform: {
                react: {
+                  development: isDev,
+                  refresh: isDev,
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
-  builtins: {
-    react: {
-      refresh: true,
-    }
-  },
  plugins: [
+    isDev && new ReactRefreshPlugin()
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```

### Deprecating builtin:sass-loader

`builtin:sass-loader` has now been deprecated. If you are using it, migrate to `sass-loader`. Rspack will remove `builtin:sass-loader` in v0.5.0.

### Deprecating experiments.incrementalRebuild

`experiments.incrementalRebuild` has now been deprecated. Rspack will remove it in v0.5.0.

### Refactoring export api in @rspack/core

Before, some APIs should not be exported accidentally exported through re-export from @rspack/core. Now with this refactor, we clean up the export APIs from @rspack/core.

This shouldn't break anything, but if you are using unintentionally exported APIs, this may break you, and you may be using Rspack in the hacky way.

If there is a real need for removed APIs from this refactor, please raise an issue in the Rspack repository.

### Deprecating `builtins.devFriendlySplitChunks` and `experiments.new_split_chunks`

In order to full migrate to Webpack's split chunks implementation, these fields are deprecated. Rspack will remove these fields in v0.5.0.

### Enable newResolver by default

[oxc_resolver](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_resolver) is now enabled by default.

`oxc_resolver` is a module resolver written in Rust provided by the [oxc project](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc). The new resolver has passed all of [enhanced-resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enhanced-resolve)'s test suite. It is 5 times faster than previous implementation, and 28 times faster than enhanced-resolve.

The new resolver can be configured to read `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions.paths` and `references` field and provides better support for nested path alias. See API [resolve.tsConfig](https://www.rspack.dev/config/resolve.html#resolvetsconfig) for details.

To opt out of the new resolver, set `experiments.rspackFuture.newResolver` to `false`.

### Migration Guide

There is a [migrate example](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/pull/2) demonstrating how to migrate from Rspack 0.3.14 to Rspack 0.4.0.

### Choose `@rspack/cli` or `Rsbuild`?

If your application is a CSR application, we strongly encourage you to use Rsbuild instead of configuring Rspack yourself, as Rsbuild is much easier to use compared to `@rspack/cli`.

### Upgrade Node.js Version

Rspack no longer supports Node.js 14 as of version 0.4.0; Node.js 16+ is now required.

### Install `@rspack/core` Manually with `@rspack/cli`

```diff title=package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
+    "@rspack/core": "0.4.0",
     "@rspack/cli": "0.4.0"
  }
}
```

### Use `builtin:swc-loader` to Support Module Transformation

Rspack no longer transforms files by default as of version 0.4.0, so you need to use `builtin:swc-loader` to transform files now. More details are available in [Deprecating Default Transformation](#deprecating-default-transformation).

### Use `@rspack/plugin-react-refresh` for React Applications

`builtin.react.refresh` does not work when we disable the default transformation, so you need to use `@rspack/plugin-react-refresh` to enable fast refresh. More details are available in [Deprecating builtin.react.refresh](#deprecating-builtinreactrefresh).
