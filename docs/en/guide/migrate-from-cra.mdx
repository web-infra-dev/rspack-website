# Migrate from Create React App

Since `@rspack/cli` has built-in support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS, etc., it is relatively easy to migrate from the Create React App.

## Updating dependencies

First, we need to update the dependencies, uninstall all the Create React App dependencies, then install the @rspack/cli dependencies and update the corresponding startup scripts.

```diff title=package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
-   "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
+   "@rspack/cli": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
-   "start": "react-scripts start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test"
+   "start": "rspack serve",
+   "build": "rspack build"
  }
}
```

## Configure rspack.config.js

Then, we need to create the `rspack.config.js` file in the root of the project to configure rspack-related options. `@rspack/cli` does not have all the CRA functionality built-in, so some additional options need to be configured as follows

```js title=rspack.config.js
/** @type {import('@rspack/cli').Configuration} */
const config = {
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.jsx', // Configure the project entry file
  },
  builtins: {
    html: [
      {
        template: './index.html', // Align CRA to generate index.html
      },
    ],
    copy: {
      patterns: [
        {
          from: 'public',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
module.exports = config;
```

## migrate ejected CRA to Rspack

After ejecting the CRA is also considered a more complex webpack project configuration, the following lists the main things to do when migrating, the detailed code can be referred to [rspack-migration-showcase/pull/6](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack-migration-showcase/pull/6)ã€‚

- Replace the webpack package with the corresponding Rspack package and replace the calling code
  - webpack -> @rspack/core
  - webpack-dev-server -> @rspack/dev-server
  - html-webpack-plugin -> @rspack/plugin-html
- Replaces the configuration that Rspack already has built-in support for
  - CSS-related functions such as style-loader, css-loader, MiniCssExtractPlugin, etc. have built-in support in Rspack
  - TerserWebpackPlugin, CssMinimizerPlugin and other code compression features have built-in support in Rspack, and are enabled by default in production mode.
  - DefinePlugin can be replaced in Rspack by [builtins.define](config/builtins#builtinsdefine)
  - ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin has built-in support in Rspack and can be turned on or off with [builtins.react.refresh](config/builtins#config/builtins#builtinsreact)
- Remove configurations that are not currently fully supported by Rspack
  - Currently cache in Rspack only supports memory caching, and it is enabled by default in development mode
  - resolve.plugins is not currently supported by Rspack
  - CaseSensitivePathsPlugin, ESLintPlugin, etc. are not currently supported in Rspack
