# Migrating from Create React App

Because Create React App (CRA) itself has many built-in capabilities, manually setting up an equivalent configuration using `@rspack/cli` can be challenging. Therefore, we recommend migrating CRA applications to [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) to leverage Rspack's capabilities.

## What is Rsbuild

**Rsbuild is an Rspack-based build tool for the web.** The main goal of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box build capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration.

Rsbuild integrates high-performance Rust-based tools from the community, including Rspack and SWC, to provide first-class build speed and development experience.

## How to Migrate

Please refer to the [Create React App Migration Guide](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/cra) provided by Rsbuild for more information.
