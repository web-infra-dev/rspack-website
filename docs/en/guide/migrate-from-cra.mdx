# Migrating from Create React App

Because Create React App (CRA) itself has many built-in capabilities, manually setting up an equivalent configuration using `@rspack/cli` can be challenging. Therefore, we recommend migrating CRA applications to [Modern.js Builder](https://modernjs.dev/builder/en) to leverage Rspack's capabilities.

## Install Dependencies

First, we need to install the relevant dependencies for Modern.js Builder and update the startup scripts.

```diff title=package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
+    "@modern-js/builder-cli": "latest",
+    "@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider": "latest",
+    "@modern-js/tsconfig": "latest",
  },
  "scripts": {
+    "start": "builder dev",
+    "build": "builder build",
+    "preview": "builder serve"
  }
}
```

## Configure builder.config.ts

Builder uses `builder.config.ts` for configuration, and you can align it with the project capabilities of CRA using the following approach:

```ts title=builder.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/builder-cli';

// https://modernjs.dev/builder/en/api/index.html
export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  html: {
    template: './public/index.html',
    disableHtmlFolder: true, // https://modernjs.dev/builder/api/config-html.html#htmldisablehtmlfolder
  },
  output: {
    distPath: {
      html: '', // https://modernjs.dev/builder/api/config-output.html#outputdistpath
    },
  },
});
```

This completes the migration from CRA's build capabilities to Rspack. You can refer to [modern-builder-cra](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/modern-builder-cra) for migration examples.
