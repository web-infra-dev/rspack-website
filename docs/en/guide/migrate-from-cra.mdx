# Migrate from Create React App

Since @rspack/cli has built-in support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS, etc., it is relatively easy to migrate from the Create React App.

## Updating dependencies

First, we need to update the dependencies, uninstall all the Create React App dependencies, then install the @rspack/cli dependencies and update the corresponding startup scripts

```diff title=package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
-   "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
+   "@rspack/cli": "latest",
+   "copy-webpack-plugin": "5.1.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
-   "start": "react-scripts start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test",
+   "start": "rspack serve",
+   "build": "rspack build",
  }
}
```

## Configure rspack.config.js

Then, we need to create the rspack.config.js file in the root of the project to configure rspack-related options. @rspack/cli does not have all the CRA functionality built-in, so some additional options need to be configured as follows

```js title=rspack.config.js
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
/*
 * @type {import('@rspack/cli').Configuration}
 */
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: '. /src/index.jsx', // Configure the project entry file
  },
  builtins: {
    html: [
      {
        template: '. /index.html', // Align CRA to generate index.html
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new CopyPlugin([
      {
        from: 'public',
        to: '.',
      },
    ]),
  ], // Copy the files from the public directory to the dist directory, aligning the behavior of the CRA
};
```
