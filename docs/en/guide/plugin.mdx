# Plugin

If [loader](/guide/loader) is the core of the file transformation (preprocessing), then plugins are the core part of the overall Rspack build process, and most of Rspack's native implementations rely on the Rust side of the plugin system.
For Node users, you don't need to worry about interoperation issues with Rust, because Rspack takes care of those details for you automatically, you just need to focus on how to use the plugins.

## Example

### Writing a plugin

The structure of the plugin is very simple, just implement an `apply` method that accepts a `Compiler` instance and will be called when the Rspack plugin is initialized. The detailed API can be found in the [Plugin API](/api/plugin).

```js
const PLUGIN_NAME = 'MyPlugin';

class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap(PLUGIN_NAME, (compilation) => {
      console.log('The Rspack build process is starting!');
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

We use CommonJS style module export so that it can be imported directly using `require` in `rspack.config.js`.

### Using plugins

Use the already compatible [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) in `rspack.config.js` :

```js title="rspack.config.js"
const BundleAnalyzerPlugin =
  require('webpack-bundle-analyzer').BundleAnalyzerPlugin;

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new BundleAnalyzerPlugin()],
};
```
