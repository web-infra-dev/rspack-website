## Bundle Analysis

Rspack cli support bundle analysis out of box with `--analyze` option. It uses [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) behind the scene.

```sh
$ rspack build --analyze
```

you can also generate stats.json file for further analysis with other bundle analysis tools like [bundle-stats](https://github.com/relative-ci/bundle-stats) or [statoscope](https://statoscope.tech/)

```sh
$ rspack build --json stats.json
```
