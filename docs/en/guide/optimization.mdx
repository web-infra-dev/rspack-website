# Production optimization

## Minification

Rspack uses the built-in minimizer to compress js and css code by default, which can be configured by [builtins.minifyOptions](config/builtins#builtinsminifyoptions). If the built-in minimizer cannot meet your needs, you can use [optimization.minimizer](config/optimization#optimizationminimizer) to set a custom minimizer.
