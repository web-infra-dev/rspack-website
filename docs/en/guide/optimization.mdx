## Bundle analysis

Rspack's Command Line Interface (CLI) supports bundle analysis out-of-box via the `--analyze` option. It uses [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) behind the scenes.

```sh
$ rspack build --analyze
```

You can also generate a `stats.json` file for further analysis with other bundle analysis tools like [bundle-stats](https://github.com/relative-ci/bundle-stats) or [statoscope](https://statoscope.tech/):

```sh
$ rspack build --json stats.json
```

## Minification

Rspack uses the built-in minimizer to compress js and css code by default, which can be configured by [builtins.minifyOptions](config/builtins#builtinsminifyoptions). If the built-in minimizer cannot meet your needs, you can use [optimization.minimizer](config/optimization#optimizationminimizer) to set a custom minimizer.
