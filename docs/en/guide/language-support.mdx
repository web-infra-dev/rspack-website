# Language support

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a first-class citizen of Rspack, and Rspack has the ability to handle TypeScript natively.

By default, we treat files ending in `*.ts` as TypeScript module types, and Rspack will use SWC to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript without additional configuration.

If you plan to migrate from Webpack, you can remove the babel-loader or ts-loader from your configuration to use Rspack's built-in TypeScript transpilation for better performance, as described in the [migration guide](/guide/migrate-from-webpack#removing-babel-loader).

### Transpile-only

Rspack will only transpile the source code, not type-check it, so you need to use other tools (e.g. tsc) to do type checking.

### isolatedModules

Rspack will transpile each module separately, so this implicitly means that [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules) is turned on by default.
Some functions, such as const enum, are dependent on parsing the entire project, so they will not be available with isolated module transpilation. You can turn this option on in `tsconfig.json ` to make Rspack's module handling behavior consistent with that in IDE hints or type checking:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "isolatedModules": true
  }
}
```

## JSX/TSX

JSX/TSX is a first-class citizen of Rspack.

By default, we treat files ending in `*.jsx` and `*.tsx` as JSX/TSX module types.

{
// TODO: link to builtin
}
If you are using another non-React Library, you can configure the JSX transpilation with the [builtins.react]() option. For example, Preact:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  builtins: {
    react: {
      pragma: 'h',
      pragmaFrag: 'Fragment',
    },
  },
};
```

## Static resource handling

Rspack supports handling of static resources, including images, fonts, videos, etc.

You need to complete the relevant configuration in `rspack.config.js`.

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.png$/,
        type: 'asset',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above options will treat all `*.png` files as asset modules, for more information on handling them see [Asset Module](/guide/asset-module).

## CSS

CSS is a first-class citizen of Rspack. Rspack has the ability to handle CSS out-of-the-box, and you don't need additional configuration to use it.

By default, we treat files ending in `*.css` as CSS module types and files ending in `*.module.css` as CSS Modules module types.

If you plan to migrate from Webpack, then you can remove the css-loader or style-loader from your configuration to use Rspack's built-in CSS processing capabilities, as described in [migration guide](/guide/migrate-from-webpack#removing-css-loader-and-style-loader-and-mini-css-extract-plugin).

### PostCSS

Rspack is compatible with [postcss-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader), which you can configure like this:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
            options: {
              postcssOptions: {
                // ...
              },
            },
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above configuration will have all `*.css` files processed by the [postcss-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader) and the resulting results will be passed to Rspack for CSS post-processing.

### Less

Rspack is compatible with [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader), which you can configure like this:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'less-loader',
            options: {
              // ...
            },
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above configuration runs all `*.css` files through the [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader) and passes the generated results to Rspack for CSS post-processing.

### Sass

Rspack is compatible with [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader), which you can configure like this:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.sass$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'sass-loader',
            options: {
              // ...
            },
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above configuration runs all `*.sass` files through the [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) and passes the resulting results to Rspack for CSS post-processing.

### CSS Modules

A CSS Modules file can be referenced in Rspack, e.g.

```ts title="index.module.css"
.red {
  color: red;
}
```

This module will be converted to a JavaScript object, which you can reference in JavaScript:

```ts title="index.js"
import { red } from '. /index.module.css';
document.getElementById('element').className = red;
```

{
// TODO: link to builtin
}

For more information on configuring CSS Modules, see [builtins.css.modules]().

## JSON

JSON is a first-class citizen of Rspack and you can import it directly, e.g.

```json title="example.json"
{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

```ts title="index.js"
import json from '. /example.json';
json.foo; // bar
```

## Node Polyfill

Rspack does not automatically introduce polyfill for Node, if you need to use the corresponding functionality, you can choose to use the `@rspack/plugin-node-polyfill` plugin and add the corresponding configuration in `rspack.config.js`:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
const NodePolyfill = require('@rspack/plugin-node-polyfill');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new NodePolyfill()],
};
```
