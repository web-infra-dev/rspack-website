# Language support

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a first-class citizen with Rspack. TypeScript processing is natively implemented.

By default, we treat files ending in `*.ts` as TypeScript module types. Rspack will use [Speedy Web Compiler (SWC)](https://swc.rs/) to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript without additional configuration.

If you're migrating from Webpack, you can remove the `babel-loader` or `ts-loader` component from your configuration to use Rspack's built-in TypeScript transpilation for better performance, as described in the [migration guide](/guide/migrate-from-webpack#removing-babel-loader).

### Transpile-only

For maximum speed, Rspack transpiles TypeScript source code without performing any type checking. An external tool such as `tsc` must be used for type checking.

### isolatedModules

To maximize parallelism, Rspack will transpile each module separately. This implies that [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules) must be enabled in your TypeScript configuration. Certain language features such as `const enum` rely on parsing the entire project, and thus cannot be used with isolated module transpilation. Enable `isolatedModules` in your `tsconfig.json ` file to ensure that your IDE hints and type checker accurately reflect Rspack's module handling behavior:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "isolatedModules": true
  }
}
```

## JSX and TSX

[JSX and TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) are first-class citizens with Rspack. By default, files ending in `*.jsx` and `*.tsx` will be handled as JSX/TSX module types.

{
// TODO: link to builtin
}
If you are using renderer other than React, you can configure the JSX transpilation with the [builtins.react]() option. For example, if you are using the [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) renderer:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  builtins: {
    react: {
      pragma: 'h',
      pragmaFrag: 'Fragment',
    },
  },
};
```

### Node polyfills

Rspack does not automatically inject polyfills for Node. If you need to use the corresponding functionality, add the `@rspack/plugin-node-polyfill` plugin and corresponding configuration in `rspack.config.js`:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
const NodePolyfill = require('@rspack/plugin-node-polyfill');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new NodePolyfill()],
};
```

## Static resource handling

Rspack supports handling of static resources, including images, fonts, videos, etc.

The relevant configuration is specified in `rspack.config.js`.

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.png$/,
        type: 'asset',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The example above will treat all `*.png` files as asset modules. For more details, see [Asset modules](/guide/asset-module).

## CSS

CSS is a first-class citizen with Rspack. Rspack has the ability to handle CSS out-of-box, so additional configuration isn't required.

By default, files ending in `*.css` are treated as CSS module types. Files ending in `*.module.css` are treated as [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) module types.

If you're migrating from Webpack, you can remove the `css-loader` or `style-loader` components from your configuration to use Rspack's built-in CSS processing capabilities, as described in [migration guide](/guide/migrate-from-webpack#removing-css-loader-and-style-loader-and-mini-css-extract-plugin).

### PostCSS

Rspack is compatible with [postcss-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader), which you can configure like this:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
            options: {
              postcssOptions: {
                // ...
              },
            },
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above configuration will have all `*.css` files processed by [postcss-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader). The output will be passed to Rspack for CSS post-processing.

### Less

Rspack is compatible with [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader), which you can configure like this:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'less-loader',
            options: {
              // ...
            },
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above configuration runs all `*.css` files through the [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader) and passes the generated results to Rspack for CSS post-processing.

### SASS

Rspack is compatible with [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader), which you can configure like this:

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.sass$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'sass-loader',
            options: {
              // ...
            },
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above configuration runs all `*.sass` files through the [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) and passes the resulting results to Rspack for CSS post-processing.

### CSS Modules

A "CSS Modules" file can be referenced in Rspack like this:

```ts title="index.module.css"
.red {
  color: red;
}
```

In the example above, the module will be converted to a JavaScript object, which you can reference in JavaScript:

```ts title="index.js"
import { red } from '. /index.module.css';
document.getElementById('element').className = red;
```

{
// TODO: link to builtin
}

For more information on configuring CSS Modules, see [builtins.css.modules](config/builtins#builtinscssmodules).

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

Installing Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin is the most seamless way to integrate it with Rspack.

#### Install Tailwind CSS

Please install [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [postcss](https://postcss.org/) and [postcss-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/) in your project.

import { Tabs, Tab } from '@theme';

<Tabs values={[{ label: 'npm' }, { label: 'yarn' }, { label: 'pnpm' }]}>
  <Tab>

```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss postcss-loader
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss postcss-loader
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
pnpm install -D tailwindcss postcss postcss-loader
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Configure Tailwind CSS

Once installed, you need to configure `postcss-loader` in `rspack.config.js` to handle CSS files, and then add `tailwindcss` to `postcssOptions.plugins`.

Here is an example configuration for handling `.css` files, if you need to handle `.scss` or `.less` files, you can refer to this example for modifications.

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
            options: {
              postcssOptions: {
                plugins: {
                  tailwindcss: {},
                },
              },
            },
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

At this point, you have completed the build configuration required to use Tailwind CSS in Rspack.

Next you can follow the steps in the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) to add the required configuration and code for Tailwind CSS and start using it.

## JSON

[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is a first-class citizen with Rspack. You can import it directly, for example:

```json title="example.json"
{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

```ts title="index.js"
import json from '. /example.json';
json.foo; // bar
```
