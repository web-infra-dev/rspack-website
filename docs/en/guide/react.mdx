## Integrate SVGR

[SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) is an universal tool to transform SVG into React components.

The way you use SVGR in Rspack is exactly the same as in webpack.

```js title=rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.svg$/i,
        issuer: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
        use: ['@svgr/webpack'],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

For detailed usage of SVGR, please refer to [SVGR Documentation - Webpack](https://react-svgr.com/docs/webpack/).
