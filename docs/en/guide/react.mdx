# React

Rspack has built-in support for JSX, which allows you to use JSX syntax directly in .jsx and .tsx files in your project. If you need to use JSX in .js or .ts files, you will need to configure it as follows:

```js title=rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        type: 'jsx',
      },
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        type: 'tsx',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Emotion

Rspack has built-in support for emotion, which allows you to use emotion syntax directly in .jsx and .tsx files in your project. You can use emotion functionality through the following configuration:

```js title=rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  builtins: {
    emotion: true,
    react: {
      importSource: '@emotion/react',
    },
  },
};
```

```js title=src/index.tsx
import { css } from '@emotion/react';

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button
      css={css`
        background: hotpink;
        &:hover {
          background: purple;
        }
      `}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Other CSS-in-JS solutions can be used by configuring the babel-loader.

## Fast Refresh

The [React Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh) feature that can be added in Rspack via [@rspack/plugin-react-refresh](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/tree/main/packages/rspack-plugin-react-refresh).

The plugin is built into @rspack/dev-server, which means that if you use @rspack/cli or @rspack/dev-server, React Fast Refresh will be enabled by default in dev mode. You can also disable React Fash Refresh with [builtins.react.refresh](config/builtins#builtinsreact).

If you are using a custom Dev Server instead of using @rspack/cli or @rspack/dev-server directly, you can add the plugin manually:

```js title=rspack.config.js
const ReactRefreshPlugin = require('@rspack/plugin-react-refresh');
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

module.exports = {
  // ...
  mode: isDev ? 'development' : 'production',
  plugins: [isDev && new ReactRefreshPlugin()].filter(Boolean),
};
```

## Integrating SVGR

[SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) is an universal tool for transforming [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) files into React components.

The usage of SVGR with Rspack is exactly the same as with Webpack.

```js title=rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.svg$/i,
        issuer: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
        use: ['@svgr/webpack'],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

For detailed usage of SVGR, please refer to [SVGR Documentation - Webpack](https://react-svgr.com/docs/webpack/).
