# Build performance profile

The Rspack CLI supports the use of the `RSPACK_PROFILE` environment variable for build performance profile.

```sh
$ RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rspack build
```

This command will generate `rspack.logging`, `rspack.trace` and `rspack.jscpuprofile` files in the current folder.

- `rspack.trace`: The time spent on each phase of the Rust side is recorded at a granular level using [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) and can be viewed using [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/)
- `rspack.jscpuprofile`: The time spent at each stage on the JavaScript side is recorded at a granular level using [Node.js inspector](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/inspector.html) and can be viewed using [speedscope.app](https://www.speedscope.app/)
- `rspack.logging`: Includes some logging information that keeps a coarse-grained record of how long each phase of the build took
