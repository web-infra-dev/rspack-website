# Quick start

Get up to speed quickly with a new Rspack based project.

## Creating project using scaffolding

### Using the Rspack CLI

You can scaffold a simple project setup using the Rspack CLI directly. Invoke the following command:

<Tabs values={[{ label: 'npm' }, { label: 'yarn' }, { label: 'pnpm' }]}>
  <Tab>

```sh
npm create rspack@latest
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
yarn create rspack
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
pnpm create rspack@latest
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then follow the input prompts in your terminal.

## Community Toolchain

There are already a few Rspack-based toolchains in the community:

- If you're looking for a React framework to build a web application, you can try [Modern.js Framework](https://modernjs.dev/en/).
- If you want to build a document site, you can try [Modern.js Doc](https://modernjs.dev/doc-tools/).
- If you want a fast and production-ready setup that works in a standalone and monorepo environment and comes with built-in tooling, you can try [Nx](https://nx.dev).

### Modern.js

Modern.js is an open source web engineering system from ByteDance that provides several Rspack-based solutions, including:

- [Modern.js Framework](https://modernjs.dev/en/): A Rspack-based progressive React framework that provides a complete solution for building web applications. It supports nested routes, server-side rendering, and provides out-of-the-box CSS solutions such as styled components and Tailwind CSS.
- [Modern.js Doc](https://modernjs.dev/doc-tools/): A Rspack-based document site framework that aims to provide developers with a simple, efficient, and scalable document site solution.

Learn more about Modern.js in the [official documentation](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/get-started/introduction).

### Using Nx

The fastest way to get up to speed quickly and leverage Rspack and React in a production-ready setting is to use the dedicated [Rspack Nx plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nrwl/rspack). This gives you a pre-configured setup, integrating Rspack with React, TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, and Cypress for e2e testing.

Run the following command to set up a new Nx workspace with React and Rspack:

<Tabs values={[{ label: 'npm' }, { label: 'yarn' }, { label: 'pnpm' }]}>
  <Tab>

```sh
npx create-nx-workspace myrspackapp --preset=@nrwl/rspack
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
yarn create nx-workspace myrspackapp --preset=@nrwl/rspack --pm=yarn
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
pnpm create nx-workspace myrspackapp --preset=@nrwl/rspack  --pm=pnpm
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The pre-configured setup is already ready to work with Rspack, TypeScript, TSX and React. In addition it also comes with Jest and Cypress for testing and ESLint for linting.

Once created you can simply `npm start` (or `pnpm start` or `yarn start`) to start the development server. You can also run `npm run build` (or `pnpm run build` or `yarn run build`) to build the application for production and similarly run `npm run test` (or `pnpm run test` or `yarn run test`) to run the unit tests.

You can learn more about Nx at [https://nx.dev](https://nx.dev).

## Manual installation

### Installation

We'll start by creating a project directory, generating an NPM `package.json`, and then installing `@rspack/cli` locally:

import { Tabs, Tab } from '@theme';

<Tabs values={[{ label: 'npm' }, { label: 'yarn' }, { label: 'pnpm' }]}>
  <Tab>

```sh
mkdir rspack-demo
cd rspack-demo
npm init -y
npm install -D @rspack/cli
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
mkdir rspack-demo
cd rspack-demo
npm init -y
yarn add -D @rspack/cli
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
mkdir rspack-demo
cd rspack-demo
npm init -y
pnpm install -D @rspack/cli
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating your first bundle

### Adding some source files

First create an entry file `src/index.js` and helper file `src/answer.js`

```js title="src/index.js"
import { answer } from './answer';
function render() {
  document.getElementById(
    'root'
  ).innerHTML = `The answer to the universe is ${answer}.`;
}
render();
```

```js title="src/answer.js"
export const answer = 42;
```

### Adding the configuration file

Rspack configures the bundle behavior by default via `rspack.config.js` whose structure is nearly identical to `webpack.config.js`. Put the `rspack.config.js` file in your project's root directory, for example:

```js title="rspack.config.js"
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.js',
  },
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

A simple way to invoke the build is `npx rspack build`. You could also customize the config file name with `npx rspack build -c <your-config-file>`. The console output will look something like this:

```sh
npx rspack build
Time: 21.388ms
```

:::info
The default stats of `@rspack/cli` only output information about errors, warnings, and timings. You can use the [`stats`](/config/stats) configuration option to output more information.
:::

At this point we have generated `main.js` and `main.js.map` files in the `dist` directory. Our configuration should have also generated the following `dist/index.html` file:

```html title="dist/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>hello rspack</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open `dist/index.html` in a web browser, and confirm that `The answer to the universe is 42.` is rendered successfully on the page.

### Adding a third-party library

Rspack can package not only local dependencies, but also third-party dependencies. Let's refactor our application to use the [React](https://reactjs.org/) renderer. First, add `react` as a `package.json` dependency:

```sh
npm install --save react@18 react-dom@18
```

Rename `src/index.js` to `src/index.jsx`. Then refactor the code to use React:

```jsx title="src/index.jsx"
import { answer } from './answer';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
const App = () => {
  return <div>the answer to the universe is {answer}</div>;
};
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

Rspack has built-in support for React, so you don't need any special configuration. But don't forget to change the `entry` in `rspack.config.js` to `src/index.jsx`:

```js title="rspack.config.js"
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.jsx',
  },
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

### Add HTML support

Rspack has built-in support for HTML, so you don't need to manually configure the path of the JavaScript bundle for the HTML file. You can use the HTML functionality like this:

```js title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.jsx',
  },
  builtins: {
    html: [{ template: './src/index.html' }],
  },
};
```

```html title="src/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello Rspack!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now invoke `npx rspack build`. Confirm that `dist/index.html` was generated with the correct JavaScript path inserted automatically:

```html title="dist/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Hello Rspack!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/main.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Rspack has built-in support for HMR. If you're using React, this includes built-in support for fast-refresh, so you don't need to configure it.

To experience HMR, invoke `npx rspack serve`. Next, make a change to the `src/answer.js` source file:

```js title="src/answer.js"
export const answer = 'Rspack';
```

You should observe that the web browser automatically updates to show `The answer to the universe is Rspack.`
