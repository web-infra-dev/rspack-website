# Introduction

Rspack is a high-performance JavaScript bundler that is designed to interoperate with the Webpack ecosystem.

## Why Rspack?

Rspack was created to solve performance challenges encountered while bundling large scale web applications at ByteDance. Its speed comes from leveraging the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language to optimize critical operations such as parsing and minification. Webpack interoperability is achieved by implementing the front end in TypeScript, using the [NAPI-RS](https://napi.rs/) framework. Rspack builds upon components from the [Speedy Web Compiler (SWC)](https://swc.rs/) project, and could also be viewed as a quicker route to fulfilling the aspirations of `swcpack` by relaxing the 100% Rust requirement.

## Compared with Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) offers a great developer experience, but its reliance on [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for production builds faces similar performance costs as other JavaScript-based algorithms. The same tradeoffs of Webpack versus Rollup also apply, for example flexibility of the `optimization.splitChunks` feature.

## Compared with ESBuild

[ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) achieves very good performance by implementing nearly all operations in Golang except for some JavaScript plugins. However, ESBuild's feature set is not as complete as Webpack, for example with respect to JavaScript Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and incremental compilation, and also the `optimization.splitChunks` feature.

## Compared with Turbopack

[Turbopack](https://turbo.build/) is implemented in Rust like Rspack, but Turbopack started over with a redesigned architecture and configuration. This brings some benefits, but presents a steeper migration cost for projects that rely on Webpack and its extensive ecosystem.

## Compared with Webpack

Rspack introduces several important performance optimizations:

- **Rust language efficiency:** The Rust programming language was specifically designed to prioritize performance, topping benchmarks for both speed and memory management. It also provides many compiler safeguards to avoid common pitfalls of other native languages such as C++.

- **Highly parallelized architecture:** Webpack is limited by Javascript's weak support for multithreading. By contrast, Rspack's native code takes full advantage of modern multi-core CPUs.

- **Built-in implementations of essential bundling features:** Webpack's hook system famously enables a vast landscape of loaders and plugins contributed by the community. Unfortunately these third-party packages can frequently lead to performance bottlenecks, perhaps because the authors did not have deep knowledge of Webpack internals, or simply because the hook system by nature limits interaction of algorithms. Rspack provides built-in implementations of key bundling features to improve performance.

- **Optimized Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** No matter how large your project is, ensuring a great experience for HMR places even steeper demands for build times than ordinary bundling. Rspack incorporates a specialized incremental compilation strategy to address this requirement.
