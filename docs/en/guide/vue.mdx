# Vue

Vue is a very popular front-end framework, and Rspack plans to provide full support for Vue in the future, offering complete engineering capabilities.

## vue-loader

Rspack's goal is to fully support vue-loader, but due to the limited APIs currently provided by Rspack, it is currently unable to directly run vue-loader. However, you can still build vue-loader's functionality yourself. Rspack provides a simple implementation of vue-loader for reference, which you can see in its entirety at [vue-example](https://github.com/modern-js-dev/rspack/tree/main/examples/vue).
