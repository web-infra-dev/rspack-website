# Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

This chapter will show you how to use Tailwind CSS in Rspack.

## Installation

Installing Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin is the most seamless way to integrate it with Rspack.

Please install [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [postcss](https://postcss.org/) and [postcss-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/) in your project.

import { Tabs, Tab } from '@theme';

<Tabs values={[{ label: 'npm' }, { label: 'yarn' }, { label: 'pnpm' }]}>
  <Tab>

```sh
$ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss postcss-loader
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
$ yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss postcss-loader
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```sh
$ pnpm install -D tailwindcss postcss postcss-loader
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

Once installed, you need to configure `postcss-loader` in `rspack.config.js` to handle CSS files, and then add `tailwindcss` to `postcssOptions.plugins`.

Here is an example configuration for handling `.css` files, if you need to handle `.scss` or `.less` files, you can refer to this example for modifications.

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
            options: {
              postcssOptions: {
                plugins: {
                  tailwindcss: {},
                },
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

At this point, you have completed the build configuration required to use Tailwind CSS in Rspack.

Next you can follow the steps in the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) to add the required configuration and code for Tailwind CSS and start using it.
