# Migration from webpack

While Rspack is expected to be as compatible as possible with Webpack's normal APIs, there are inevitably some differences or higher performance implementations of the same functionality in Rspack.

## Configuring migration

### Removing babel-loader

Rspack already has built-in support for TypeScript and JSX as well as the latest Javascript syntax, which means that if your babel-loader is only designed to support TypeScript, JSX and the newer Javascript syntax, then you can remove the babel-loader altogether.
If your babel-loader is designed to support custom conversion logic, then this part of the babel-loader can be kept, but we discourage users from using the babel-loader for large numbers of files, as it can cause serious performance deterioration.

```diff
 module.exports = {
  module: {
   rules: [
-    {
-       test: /\.tsx?$/i,
-       use: [{
-         loader: 'babel-loader',
-         options: {
-           presets: ['@babel/preset-typescript'],
-         },
-       }],
-       test: /\.jsx?$/i,
-       use: [{
-         loader: 'babel-loader',
-         options: {
-           presets: ['@babel/preset-react'],
-         },
-       }],
-     },
    ],
  },
 };
```

Rspack also supports JavaScript syntax downgrading by default, which means you don't need to use babel-loader to support browser compatibility anymore, you can specify browser compatibility via target.

```diff
module.exports = {
+ target: [ 'es5'],
   module: {
   rules: [
-    {
-       test: /\.jsx?$/i,
-       use: [{
-         loader: 'babel-loader',
-         options: {
-           presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
-         },
-       }],
-     },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Removing css-loader and style-loader and mini-css-extract-plugin

The native css module type has built-in support for css, css hmr, css module, and css extraction, which means you don't need to configure a separate css-loader and style-loader and mini-css-extract-plugin for css files. extract-plugin.

```diff
- const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
-     {
-       test: /\.css$/i,
-       use: [isDev ? "style-loader" : MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader , "css-loader"],
-     },
+      {
+        test: /\.css$/i,
+        type: 'css', // this is enabled by default for .css, so you don't need to specify it
+      }
    ],
  },
  plugins: []
};
```

For the [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) function, it is enabled by specifying css/module as the module type.

```diff

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
+ {
+   test: /\.module\.css$/i,
+   type: 'css/module', // this is enabled by default for module.css,   so you don't need to specify it
+  }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Using Asset Modules instead of file-loader and url-loader

Rspack is aligned with webpack 5's Asset Modules, which means you can use Asset Modules instead of file-loader and url-loader.

```diff
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
+ {
+   test: /\. (png|jpe?g|gif)$/i,
+   type: 'asset/resource',
+ },
- {
-   test: /\. (png|jpe?g|gif)$/i,
-   use: [{
-        loader: 'file-loader',
-   }]
- }
    ]
  },
}
```

### Using builtins.html instead of html-webpack-plugin

Rspack has built-in support for html, which means you can use builtins.html instead of html-webpack-plugin.

```diff
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
module.exports = {
  builtins: [
+ html: [
+   {
+    template: 'index.html',
+    filename: 'index.html',
+   }
+ ]
  ],
- plugins: [
-    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
-     template: 'index.html',
-     filename: 'index.html',
-    }),
- ]
}
```
