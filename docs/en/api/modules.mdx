## Modules

While rspack supports multiple module syntaxes, we recommend following a single syntax for consistency and to avoid odd behaviors/bugs.

### ES6(Recommended)

Rspack support ES6 module syntax natively, you can use static `import`„ÄÅ `export` and `import()` syntax.

### CommonJS

Rspack is also support `CommonJS` syntax natively, you can use `require` and `module.exports` syntax.

### Webpack

Aside from the module syntaxes described above, rspack also support some webpack-specific methods.

#### require.context

```ts
require.context(
  (directory: String),
  (includeSubdirs: Boolean) /* optional, default true */,
  (filter: RegExp) /* optional, default /^\.\/.*$/, any file */,
  (mode: String) /* optional, 'sync' | 'eager' | 'weak' | 'lazy' | 'lazy-once', default 'sync' */
);
```

Specify a whole group of dependencies using a path to the `directory`, an option to `includeSubdirs`, a filter for more fine grained control of the modules included, and a mode to define the way how loading will work.
If mode is set to 'lazy', the underlying modules will be loaded asynchronously.

## Module Variables

### module.hot(webpack-specific)

Indicates whether or not Hot Module Replacement is enabled and provides an interface to the process. See the [HMR API page](/api/hmr) for details.

### import.meta.webpackHot(webpack-specific)

An alias for `module.hot`, however `import.meta.webpackHot` can be used in strict ESM while module.hot can't.

### __dirname (NodeJS)

Depending on the configuration option `node.__dirname`:

- false: Not defined
- mock: equal to '/'
- true: node.js \_\_dirname
  If used inside an expression that is parsed by the Parser, the configuration option is treated as true.

### __resourceQuery(webpack-specific)

The resource query of the current module. If the following require call was made, then the query string would be available in file.js.

```ts
require('file.js?test');
```

file.js

```ts
__resourceQuery === '?test';
```

### **webpack_modules**(webpack-specific)

Access to the internal object of all modules.

### **webpack_hash**(webpack-specific)

It provides access to the hash of the compilation.

### **webpack_public_path**(webpack-specific)

Equals the configuration option's output.publicPath.
