# Case

## all

A combination of `atlaskit-editor`, `common-libs`, `common-libs-chunks`, `rome`

## atlaskit-editor

Basic react application with `@atlaskit/editor-core`

## common-libs

A combination of some widely used libraries in Javascript ecosystem.

## common-libs-chunks

Same as `common-libs`, but using async `import()` syntax to force bundler generate multiple chunks.

## rome

the old Rome code base (prior to their Rust rewrite) to approximate a large TypeScript codebase.

## react-components-10000

10000 react components (each component only have basic skeleton, complicated logic maybe lead a rerender time may greater than hmr time) to test hot module replacement performance of each devServer of bundler.

# Metrics

- dev-cold: the time it takes for the development build to complete without caching.
- production-build: the time it takes for the production build to complete without caching.
- hmr: the time it takes for the development server rebuild the project when an update is applied to a source file.
